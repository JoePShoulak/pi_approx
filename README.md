# Pi Approximater #
## Archived ##

This is an older project of mine from earlier in my coding career. I don't feel like making it private or deleting it, but this project does not necessarily reflect my current methodology as a developer. No further changes have been made. 

## About ##
This is a program that approximates Pi by many methods, and compares the methods to each other for the number of iterations you choose.

I do not plan to add a CLI to this.
